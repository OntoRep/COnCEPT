# COnCEPT upper-level Design Ontology (COnDO)
COnDO is an upper-level ontology which is designed aiming to support the designer in various activities of knowledge management during the initial stage of the product design process.

The initial version of the COnCEPT COnDO ontology is based on the concepts introduced by Offenbach theory of Product Language (Gross, 1987; Steffen, 2007; Steffen 2009). Moreover, it is extended and initiated with the concepts suggested by end-user partners of the COnCEPT consortium as well as leveraging the concepts gathered in the literature review (e.g. Mougenot, 2007; Guaenand, 2003).

#Overview of ontology
High level classes of COnDO help to sharing information between products and design teams and associate content to products. Profiles and metadata can be extended with other conceptual classifications or generic ontologies such as FOAF or those provided by semantic desktops such as Nepomuk. Guidelines for mapping to other ontologies are provided.

Following the conceptual model defined by Gross COnDO makes a distinction between the practical functions of a product (and various others such as ergonomical, economical, ecological functions) on the one hand, and the formal and communicative aspects, the so-called product language functions on the other. Analogous to the differentiation commonly deployed in a science of language between syntax and semantics the specific object of product language is subdivided into formal aesthetic functions, i.e. those aspects that can be observed irrespective of the meaning of their content â€“ and the semantic functions. Following distinction between sign and symbol, he then proceeded to differentiate between sign functions or indication functions and symbolic functions.

It is assumed that this overall conceptual model will remain quite stabile and extensions will be done mainly by extending or specializing the subcategories defined by it. More detailed conceptualizations of subcategories based on this model are shown in more detail in the following diagrams.
